            <p> A research paper is an integral part of being a graduate student in the Information Architecture, Technical Communication and Information Design, and Technical Communication programs at IIT. <br><br>
                There is no right or wrong way to put a paper together, but there are a wealth of tools available to make the process efficient and manageable. In this course, you will find an explanation of the basic steps involved in writing a research paper, as well as a selection of tools that complement certain steps. 
                <br><br>
                If you are new to writing research papers, this course will guide you through each of the basic steps; even if you are an experienced writer, you can still refresh your knowledge with one or more lessons. <strong>To begin, choose a lesson by clicking one of the modules in the navigation bar above</strong>.
